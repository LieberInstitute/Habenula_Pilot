Folder: 99_paper_figs

Description:
Each file is pretty much self-explanatory. This is the folder of code only used to make our finalized paper figures. The source_colors.R is the official list of colors used in the paper for the bulk and sn resolutions.

Please note that the gene marker tables are to be added to the paper as supplementary table. The sn resolution gene markers can be found in "99_paper_figs/10c_snResolution_Top_Markers" whereas the bulk resolution gene markers can be found in "99_paper_figs/10_bulk_Deconvo_OPC_clean" (we only used the OPC cleaned data for our downstream analyses including the bulk deconvolution).
