#### Description ####

- **prep_manifest.R**
 
This folder was grandfathered in from the legacy code. 
It grabs information from the FastQ files (the rawest form of snRNASeq data 
possible) and writes them into their respective tables in prepartion for later
analysis.

Please note that the Habenula project involves both snRNA-seq and bulkRNA-seq
analysis. The following folder focuses on the bulkRNA-seq data. Be mindful of 
the type of data involved in each folder.
